            <h1>Queen - Bohemian Rhapsody</h1>
            <p>Is this the real life?<br> 
                Is this just fantasy?<br>
                Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality.<br> 
                Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see. <br>
                I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy,<br> 
                Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low.<br>
                Anyway the wind blows <br>
                Doesn't really matter to me, to me. <br> 
                <br>
                Mama just killed a man<br>
                Put a gun against his head <br>
                Pulled my trigger, now he's dead. <br>
                Mama, life had just begun<br>
                But now I've gone and thrown it all away.<br> 
                Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry,<br> 
                If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,<br> 
                Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters.<br> 
                <br>
                Too late, my time has come<br>
                Sends shivers down my spine<br>
                Body's aching all the time. <br>
                Good bye, everybody, I've got to go<br>
                Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth. <br>
                <br>
                Mama, ooh (anyway the winds blow), I don't wanna die<br>
                I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.<br> 
                <br>
                I see a little silhouette of a man, <br>
                Scaramouche, scaramouche, will you do the Fandango. <br>
                Thunderbolt and Lightning, very very fright'ning me. <br>
                <br>
                (Galileo) Galileo<br> 
                (Galileo) Galileo <br>
                Galileo figaro, magnifico. <br>
                <br>
                I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me.<br>
                He's just a poor boy from a poor family,<br> 
                Spare him his life from this monstrosity.<br> 
                <br>
                Easy come, easy go, will you let me go? <br>
                Bis-mil-lah ! <br>
                No, we will not let you go. (Let him go) <br>
                Bis-mil-lah ! <br>
                We will not let you go. (Let him go) <br>
                Bis-mil-lah ! <br>
                We will not let you go. (Let me go) <br>
                Will not let you go. (Let me go) <br>
                Will not let you go. (Let me go) <br>
                <br>
                Ah. <br>
                No, no, no, no, no, no, no (Oh mamma mia, mamma mia)<br> 
                Mamma mia, let me go.<br> 
                Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me. <br>
                <br>
                So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye,<br>
                So you think you can love me and leave me to die.<br>
                Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby, <br>
                just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Nothing really matters, anyone can see, <br>
                Nothing really matters, <br>
                Nothing really matters to me. <br>
                Anyway the wind blows.<br>
